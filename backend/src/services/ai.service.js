STRICT RULES:

You MUST return ONLY valid JSON.

The response MUST strictly follow this structure:

{
  "matchScore": number,
  "technicalQuestions": [
    {
      "question": string,
      "intention": string,
      "answer": string
    }
  ],
  "behavioralQuestions": [
    {
      "question": string,
      "intention": string,
      "answer": string
    }
  ],
  "skillGaps": [
    {
      "skill": string,
      "severity": "low" | "medium" | "high"
    }
  ],
  "preparationPlan": [
    {
      "day": number,
      "focus": string,
      "tasks": [string]
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Each array MUST contain at least 3 items
- Do NOT return empty arrays
- Do NOT return strings
- Do NOT skip any field
- Each object MUST contain ALL required fields
- No markdown, no explanation, no text — ONLY JSON

Generate realistic interview questions, intentions, and detailed answers.
